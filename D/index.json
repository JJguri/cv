We quantified the share of different drivers of yield variability stemming from climatic factors (drought, heat stress, climate change) and non-climatic factors (irrigation strategy and cultivars) for irrigated systems and measured the associated uncertainty of each driver in climate change impact studies. We used a combination of process-based crop models with machine-learning algorithms to explore the underlying reasons for yield variability over 18 years of irrigated maize in Andalusia, Spain. The drivers of variability were identified at different irrigation strategies, cultivated with different cultivars.

More specifically, we addressed the below key questions:\n Which climatic and non-climatic factors are dominant in explaining irrigated maize yield variability for impact assessment studies? Which factor contributes the greatest share to yield variability? How do the drivers of maize yield variability differ under different genotypes, irrigation strategies, sowing dates, and crop model structures? How do the roles of different factors change under different climatic extremes? What is the level of uncertainty stemming from different drivers for climate change impact assessment studies?

The two hypotheses to test and either providence evidence for or reject are:\n Extensive/mixed agroecosystems are higher in diversity and/or more resilient to climate change than highly specialized systems, such as monocultures.

This study highlights the need to:\n Separately quantify the impact of input data aggregation on model outputs to inform about data aggregation error. Identify those variables that explain these aggregation errors.  In line with previous studies, DAEc was mainly driven by differences in elevation and DAEs were largely influenced by soil properties. Climate input data, mainly rainfall, play a key role as a driver of potato yield variability at high spatial resolution. At coarser resolutions, soil data aggregation can strongly affect simulated potato yield (under rainfed conditions) and IWR. This study can guide crop modelers when choosing the spatial resolution for regional simulation related to regional water use and climate change impact assessments. More research is needed to assess model responses to other potato management practices, such as nitrogen fertilization rate, planting density, and genotype. Crop modeling using input data at coarse resolution needs to consider DAEc and DAEs to quantify the bias associated with data aggregation. This bias, which may be significant, may skew decisionmaking at the regional level.\nAchievements Paper published in Science of the Total Environment\nHost Researchers in Germany Dr Ehsan Eyshi Rezaei and Dr Stefan Siebert\nFunded by Australia-Germany Joint Research Co-operation Scheme, Universities Australia, German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD)\n","date":1555718400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1555718400,"objectID":"9d3deda9323a9a4f44c18c199ae717ad","permalink":"//localhost:1313/stays/gottingen/","publishdate":"2019-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/stays/gottingen/","section":"stays","summary":"2019 - Visiting Researcher","tags":["Data resolution","Scale","Regional modelling","Data aggregation","Spatial heterogeneity","Input uncertainty","Drought","Heat stress","Climate Change","Weather data"],"title":"University of Gottingen","type":"stays"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"About Ranju Ranju is a young researcher originally from Nepal.

Specific research questions\n What are the dominant sources of uncertainty in crop model systems, using potato and wheat as example crops? How much weight does each uncertainty source contribute to the total uncertainty? What is the relative contribution of different sources of uncertainty with crop model systems, using potato as an example crop?  Hypotheses\n Uncertainty in soil data outweighs uncertainty due to climate and management practices in crop model systems. The weight of climate uncertainty is higher than other uncertainty sources in crop model systems. The ensemble of crop models reduces uncertainty.

Crop models produce actionable information on issues related to food security, climate change, land-use change, and market dynamics. Despite increasing importance and use, various sources of uncertainty exist in the modeling process due to the “impossibility to model the cropping system with complete determinism”. In this Ph.D. project, by uncertainty, we mean “any departure from the unachievable ideal of complete determinism”. Uncertainty exists in each step of the crop modeling processes. Observational data is imperfect and often non-standard, with varying sources over different spatial and temporal scales. This can lead to uncertainty surrounding inputs selected, but also has implications during model development (e.g. model structure) and tuning (e.g. model parameter selection). Hence, uncertainty can be grouped into three categories- a) observation uncertainty, b) prediction uncertainty and c) model uncertainty. These three categories of uncertainty are closely related but different from one another. Addressing these uncertainties is extremely important, as this will allow the user to better understand the level of confidence in the model outputs and select actionable practices accordingly. As such, this Ph.D. project focuses on the historical and current research gaps, trends and challenges in estimating uncertainty in crop modeling to answer the following research questions:\n Are temporal dynamics considered in model uncertainty assessments (e.g. future scenarios)? If so, is there a bias to assess future climate uncertainty? How does crop model uncertainty decompose? Does the decomposition follow any methodology? Does each assessment specify the model uncertainty source analyzed, and if so, which source of model uncertainty is considered? Are interactions between sources of uncertainties considered? Is there a predominance of studies assessing model uncertainty for a specific model output (e.g. crop yield)? Which statistics or mathematical approaches (e.g. Bayesian, ANOVA) are used to quantify the model uncertainties? Which key gaps exist in understanding, characterizing, and assessing crop model uncertainty? Which are the possible ways to reduce crop model uncertainty?

West Lafayette, Indiana, US Period From May 2015 to Mar 2016\nActivities   I modified APSIM Classic so that it could accurately predict growth and yield of switchgrass and Miscanthus; two plant species that are not yet represented in this large, multi-species model. I altered two existing APSIM sub-models (lucerne, sugarcane) using knowledge of species-specific differences in growth, development and agronomic practices. In brief, the modifications for Miscanthus include radiation use efficiency and biomass partitioning. The modifications for Switchgrass were more extensive and included the thermal time calculation, biomass partitioning, radiation use efficiency, transpiration efficiency, temperature dependency of photosynthesis and the light extinction coefficient. I also assembled large databases for soils and weather that I could subsequently associate with site-specific yield data of both species and successfully calibrated and validated both of these new sub-models. These new APSIM sub-models predict the yield of both species across broad geographies from the East Coast to the Great Plains of the US.\n  I altered the APSIM maize model routine in substantive ways to predict corn yield in continuous corn and soybean-corn rotations. First, I successfully calibrated and validated the model using data from the Eastern corn belt of the US. I then used water flow and agronomic data from Purdue’s Water Quality Field Station (WQFS) to calibrate the water use/drainage sub-routine of water balance data that can be obtained. This enabled to make improvement in the APSIM maize model not otherwise possible.\n  Achievements Publications\n  Ojeda JJ, Volenec JJ, Brouder SM, Caviglia OP, Agnusdei MG (2017) Evaluation of Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) as yield predictor of Panicum virgatum and Miscanthus x giganteus in several US environments.

We used experimental field data collected in several locations of Argentina and Australia to evaluate the ability of APSIM Classic to simulate the growth patterns of annual and perennial forage crops and to predict dry matter yields in these regions.
