      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jonathan is a Junior Research Fellow at the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, University of Tasmania. His research interests are in quantifying the effects of crop management and climate variability on soil-crop processes and integrating data into mechanistic models at different spatial scales. He has a passionate interest in disentangle sources of uncertainties in biophysical and mathematical models to better predict crop growth, both yield and quality and environmental impacts in agricultural systems. This requires a broad understanding of how the environment influences crop growth and development; how rainfall, irrigation, and fertilizer influence soil conditions; how crops obtain water and nutrients from the soil; how soil processes contribute to the loss of carbon and nitrogen; and how all these processes interact.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last 20 years, Dr. Brown developed knowledge of a wide range of processes that span a range of traditional disciplines. However, his greatest strength is in the ability to integrate knowledge from various fields and sources into models that summarise this knowledge and provide frameworks and tools for ongoing research and extension. As a result, he has become an expert in plant model development and application. The types of models he develops and the applications are broad but he is particularly interested in the expansion of plant models to better account for the effects of a wider range of biotic and abiotic factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown is also an expert in the field of crop and soil water studies where he has developed a detailed understanding of the impact of soil and weather on crop water use and crop growth. He has designed and commissioned sophisticated systems for soil water measurement and developed new approaches for monitoring canopy energy balance and estimating evapotranspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brown and Dr. Ojeda are collaborating on the development of Python tools e.g. 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/HamishBrownPFR/APSIMTools/blob/master/PotatoCalibration.ipynb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PotatoCalibration&lt;/a&gt; to test crop model configuration. They are also developing an updated version of a potato model in APSIM Next Generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamali is a post-doctoral researcher in the Research Platform &amp;ldquo;Models &amp;amp; Simulation&amp;rdquo; at the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Germany. Dr. Kamali&amp;rsquo;s general research interest is large scale agroecosystem modeling, development, and implementation of approaches for model calibration, parameter estimation, and data assimilation. She is interested to learn methods to assimilate real-time remote-sensing data into agro-ecosystem models for a more accurate prediction of agricultural productivity and improved management of agricultural systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ojeda hosted Dr. Kamali in Hobart to work in a joint research project under the 
&lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/project/project-2/&#34;&gt;Australia-Germany Joint Research Co-operation Scheme&lt;/a&gt;. They used a combination of process-based crop models with machine-learning algorithms to explore the underlying reasons for yield variability over 18 years of irrigated maize in Andalusia, Spain. The drivers of variability were identified at different irrigation strategies, cultivated with different cultivars. The underlying factors of yield variability were measured and the possible pathways to reduce yield variabilities were investigated. They are writing two papers together which will be submitted soon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr Keith Pembleton is an Associate Professor in Plant Agricultural Science and the Group Research Leader of the Agricultural Systems Modelling Research group at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). He has a diverse research and teaching portfolio ranging from pasture and crop physiology and agronomy to whole farm system and catchment modelling and analysis. He has a long history of working alongside and providing research support to the Australian dairy industry in both the temperature and subtropical dairy regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Pembleton&amp;rsquo;s research group brings together biophysical crop and soil modellers with software developers to develop new and novel applications of existing models as well as develop new models and tools. At the centre of his program is a focus on understanding and minimising the risks within forage production systems. Dr Pembleton is the chair of the APSIM Initiative reference panel which has been established to promote the development and use of the science modules and infrastructure software of APSIM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Ojeda and Dr Pembleton started collaborations 7 years ago and they continue building research projects together. Currently, they are collaborating in two modelling projects. One project 
&lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/project/project-3/&#34;&gt;(CRC)&lt;/a&gt; is focused on the development of models to predict the effect of soil constraints on crop productivity. The second project 
&lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/project/project-1/&#34;&gt;(COALAR)&lt;/a&gt; aims to develop an integrated tool (remote sensing and biophysical models) to assess the impact of climate change on livestock productivity in Australia and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dr. Waha is an agricultural geographer and geo-ecologist interested in multidisciplinary research to understand interactions between the atmosphere, biosphere and human societies of relevance for agricultural systems. She has been trained as a physical geographer and climate change impact scientist and earned MSc and PhD degrees from the universities of Leipzig and Potsdam in Germany and moved to Australia in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katharina is a team leader in the 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://research.csiro.au/foodglobalsecurity/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Food Systems and Global Change Team&lt;/a&gt; at CSIRO. Her two areas of interest are: climate change impacts on agriculture and adaptation, and the geography, structure and evolution of agricultural systems. Geographers are interested in anything affecting the spatial patterns of the Earthâs surface and for her, the most interesting drivers are global change and human development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core methods and tools that she develops and/or deploys are process-based cropping systems modelling, spatial analysis with GIS and R, scenario analysis, social science methods, uncertainty analysis, data integration and multi-scale analysis. Her recent research aims at contributing to a better understanding of the relationship between agricultural diversification and food security and the importance of multiple cropping for food production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Waha and Dr. Ojeda conducted a joint 
&lt;a href=&#34;//localhost:1313/phd/francesco/&#34;&gt;Ph.D. project&lt;/a&gt; between CSIRO and UTAS. This project aims to explore the benefits and limits of agricultural diversification in contrasting farming systems.&lt;/p&gt;
