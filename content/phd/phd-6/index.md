### About Daian

Daian is an Agricultural Engineer from the University of Entre Rios (2017) and 
Graduate Research Fellow at the National Research Council (CONICET), Argentina. 
He has worked on numerous projects related with GIS programs, 
satellite imagery and geo-spatial databases. During the last years, he worked processing geo-spatial crop and soil information 
for several public organisations in the Argentinian agri-food sector. He is doing a PhD in 
Agricultural Sciences and currently, Daian is a teaching assistant of the Business Planning and Management course 
at [FCA](http://www.fca.uner.edu.ar/), University of Entre Rios.

### About the project

The current crop sequences in the Argentinian Pampas are mostly based on soybeans as the only 
crop in the year. This configuration results in high **Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE)** 
due to the **Biological Nitrogen Fixation (BNF)** of soybeans and the low use of nitrogen fertilisers in 
cereals. However, this crop configuration compromises ecosystem services and generates dis-services 
that reduce the system sustainability and generate growing concern in society that show the need to 
design new crop sequences. In this project, we propose to contrast the soy-centric model with 
reconfigured sequences based on three elements: (i) double crops (winter crops and summer 
crops with different combinations of cereals and/or legumes), (ii) winter legume cover crops 
and (iii) a higher proportion of cereals. This higher proportion of cereals in the alternative 
sequences implies a higher requirement of N fertilisers, which could reduce NUE, and a greater 
potential to increase **Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2 </sub>O) emissions**, a gas with a powerful greenhouse 
effect. To neutralise this situation, the alternatives crop sequences include winter legumes that 
contribute to BNF, and corn, a highly efficient cereal intrinsic in the use of N. This project 
addresses problems at different scales: a) at the **plant and crop scales**, the potential reduction 
of BNF due to the higher frequency of hypoxia and higher temperatures associated with climate change; 
b) at the **farm (paddock) and regional scales**, unreliable methods for quantifying and modelling emissions 
of N<sub>2</sub>O and BNF, and c) at the **regional scale**, the uncertainty due to the effects of 
climate change on the stability of yields, and the N balance components in the long-term. 
_**The general objective of the project is to compare the dominant soybean-centric sequence in 
the Pampas region with alternative crop sequences, with a primary focus on BNF and its relationship 
with grain production, NUE and N<sub>2 </sub>O emissions**_. To achieve this objective we propose an 
approach at different spatio-temporal scales, from short-term physiological processes in the plant 
to the long-term regional level where the environmental impacts associated with the N economy 
are manifested in future climatic conditions. To capture this range of scales we designed a 
project that complements: (i) experiments in controlled conditions (glasshouse) and field experiments; 
(ii) climate change projection models and crop simulation models coupled using geographic 
information systems and remote sensing products; (iii) updated theories and specific hypotheses 
for each component of the project, and (iv) a scientific team with proven knowledge of the 
production systems under study and with a diversity of perspectives.
