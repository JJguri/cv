### About the PhD project

The growing demand for beef and dairy products requires technological options to improve 
the productivity and resource use efficiency of forages crops with less environmental impact. 
Livestock production systems based on forage crop sequences (FCS) could be more productive 
and efficient than those based on perennial pastures (PP). However, there are many questions 
about the FCS implementation related to the system stability in the long term and about 
the root-derived soil organic carbon in these systems. The main objective of this thesis was 
to provide original knowledge about the main ecophysiological aspects determining forage supply 
in livestock systems based on the use of FCS and PP.

The study was conducted in three steps 
(i) above-ground dry matter yield (AGDM) and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) were analyzed 
in Rafaela, Pergamino, General Villegas and Trenque Lauquen, (ii) in Balcarce were evaluated 
AGDM, below-ground dry matter yield (BGDM), PUE (i.e. **water capture [WC]** * **water use efficiency [WUE]**), 
radiation productivity (RP, i.e. **radiation capture [RC]** * **radiation use efficiency [RUE]**) and 
soil carbon (C) variations in different **organic matter** fractions. Finally, (iii) **Agricultural 
Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)** was calibrated and validated to analyze the accumulated 
annual precipitation, AGDM and PUE variability using a long-term climate database (30 years).

In general, the AGDM was higher for the FCS than the PP treatments, although more variable 
in the long term. Below-ground dry matter yield was similar for both treatments. Likewise, 
there was a greater association between the contribution of C and BGDM in sub-surface horizons 
below than 0,15 m soil depth. The PP treatments shown higher RC and similar WC than the FCS treatments.
However, FCS shown higher RUE and WUE, which led to higher RP and PUE. In turn, the PP treatments 
shown lower inter-annual variability of PUE than FCS in the long term. The multi-environmental 
analysis on the impacts of different forage cropping systems on PUE, as well as on the **soil C** 
variations, provide key knowledge and information to **_develop management strategies to increase 
the sustainable productivity of livestock systems in the Argentinean Pampas_**.
