###### Responsibilities:

**Applied Research**

- Lead a global project [(Niche)](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/about/committed-grants/2021/10/inv030103) focused on the development and deploy of predictive analytics framework to improve on-farm field trials, refine seed product profiles and optimize seed varietal placement to further climate adaptation for small-scale producers. Funded by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation this project includes >12 team members from 4 organisations located in 5 continents [more info here](https://nasaharvest.org/news/regrow-leads-5m-project-niche-optimize-crop-variety-placement-sub-saharan-africa).	
- Develop and deploy new solutions for [FluroSense](https://www.regrow.ag/flurosense), a digital agronomy and conservation monitoring platform which integrates large scale automated analysis with farm management systems (e.g. Climate FieldView, Agrian, Proagrica).
-	Work with the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) science and remote sensing science teams to develop and implement algorithms that help improve soil-crop management practices internationally (focus on US, Australia, and LATAM, expanding into EU).
