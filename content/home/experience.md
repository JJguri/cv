###### Responsibilities:
  
**Teaching and Learning**
- Teach undergraduate subjects into the UQ plant/crop science program.
- Supervise students at honours and postgraduate level.

**Research**
- Undertake a program of research (led by [Prof Scott Chapman](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=v-giX5UAAAAJ&hl=en)) as part of the
[TERRA project](https://www.purdue.edu/terra/) led by Purdue University. We 
developed a new version of [pSIMS](https://github.com/JJguri/psimsV2) to predict biomass sorghum across US environments using gridded data. 
- Assist in supervision and engagement with PhD and Master’s students at Purdue and UQ, and utilise APSIM to 
undertake simulations for the phenotyping of biomass sorghum using experiments from the project. Parameterise APSIM and use weather, 
soil and other datasets to undertake scenario analysis of adaptation of biomass sorghum to diverse environments, primarily in the USA.
- Collaborate in an experimental trial combining farm, drone data and satellite imagery looking at photosynthesis and RUE (Radiation Use Efficiency) 
differences between forage sorghum genotypes with Pacific Seeds Australia (ADVANTA).

###### Responsibilities:
  
**Basic research and methods**
- Uncertainty analysis in climate change impact studies for irrigated maize systems in Spain.
- Impact assessment of livestock farm performances regionally under different climate change scenarios in Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay.
- Development of a tool to download gridded climate data in an APSIM format from SILO datasets across Australia.
- Model phenological variation with sowing date and cultivar for lentil and faba bean against the climatic patterns of frost and heat in Australia. 
- Coupling existing multiple-scaling and remote-sensing techniques with advanced biophysical models to evaluate drivers of yield variability in Australia, Argentina, and Uruguay.
- Quantification of crop model uncertainties (input, structure and parameter uncertainty) using sensitivity analysis tools such as Sobol, Morris, ANOVA.
- Examine alternative existing model-scaling techniques and assess drivers of yield variability at the regional scale (gridded based crop simulations).
- Point-based crop model calibration/validation under the Water for Profit program in Tasmania, Australia.
- Develop a new potato module in APSIM Next Generation. Evaluating how accurately APSIM NG simulates potato productivity across several agricultural systems worldwide.

**Applied research and industry engagement**
- Develop a virtual tool to analyze future scenarios to decision support for dual-purpose crops (canola and wheat) in Tasmania (Australia) in collaboration with GRDC and CSIRO.
- Collect and organize several potato agricultural datasets (climate, soil and crop management) from industry partners across Tasmania (Simplot and McCain) for modelling purposes and scenario analysis with farmers.
- Conduct workshops with Australian farming groups under a CRC Soil project focused on model development to evaluate the effect of soil constraints on crop and soil productivity.
- Lead workshops with livestock industry decision-makers who will perform foresight exercises to explore alternative futures under climate change scenarios in Argentina, Uruguay, and Australia.

**Coaching, supervision and leadership activities**
- Supervise Ph.D. students in collaboration with external co-supervisors (CSIRO Brisbane and Toowoomba).
- UTAS Data Network Co-director (Mar-2019 to Nov-2019). Lead discussion and meeting for a group of researchers interested in data management across the University.
