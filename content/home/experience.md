###### Responsibilities:
  
**Basic research and methods**
- Quantification of crop model uncertainties (input, structure and parameter uncertainty) using sensitivity analysis tools. Lead a cooperative project with German and Spanish partners.
- Examine alternative existing model-scaling techniques and assess the drivers of yield variability at regional scale (gridded based crop simulations) for the potential agricultural areas under several environments.
- Point based crop model calibrations and validations under the Water for Profit project funded by DPIPWE, Tasmania.
- Develop a new potato module in APSIM Next Gen. Evaluating how accurately APSIM Next Gen simulates potato productivity across several agricultural systems worldwide.

**Applied research and industry engagement**
- Developing a virtual tool to analyse future scenarios to decision support for dual-purpose crops (canola and wheat) in Tasmania in collaboration with Grains Research and Developmen Corporation and CSIRO.
- Collecting and organize several potato agricultural datasets (climate, soil and crop management) from industry partners across Tasmania (Simplot and McCain) with modelling purposes.
- Conduct workshops with Australian farming groups under a CRC Soil project focus on the development of model to evaluate the effect of soil coinstraints on crop productivity. 

**Couching, supervision and leadership activities**
- Supervise PhD students in collaboration with external co-supervisors (CSIRO, IMAS-UTAS).
- UTAS Data Network Co-director (Mar-2019 to Nov-2019). Lead discussion and meeting for a group of people interested in data magement across the University.

###### Responsibilities:

**Research**
- Apply ecophysiology concepts to the management of annual/perennial cropping systems for forage and grain production through field experimentation and biophysical simulation models, with emphasis on improving resource use efficiency with minimal environmental impact.
- Use simulation models to analyze and predict the long-term productivity and stability of different cropping systems, encouraging the sustainable intensification of farm crop/forage production systems and improving environmental resources management strategies (solar radiation, soil water, and nutrients [mainly N]) while reducing environmental risks and climatic uncertainty.
- Analyze and organize data for climate, soil, crop production, and management from five locations across Argentinian Pampas.
- Calibrate and validate APSIM to predict biomass production at the crop and sequence level.
- Design and conduct a 3-year field experiment in Balcarce, Argentina (May 2012 to May 2015).
- Conduct probe calibration for Argiudoll soil in Balcarce, Argentina.
- Data analysis and dissertation manuscript writing.

**Teaching**
- Research and teaching “Crop Physiology and Ecology”.
- Undergraduate course (~50 students).
- Supervision of staff (international students).
