abstract: |
  Agricultural diversity can contribute to improving agriculture and food systems sustainability, 
  but it is commonly associated with smallholdings and subsistence farming. The drivers and 
  trade-offs around diversification strategies in high-income countries remain poorly understood. 
  Tasmania, due to its diverse climate and geography, is among the most agro-diverse regions in 
  Australia, which makes it an interesting case to study.

  This paper addresses three main research questions:  
  (1) How do farmers define agricultural diversity and diversification?  
  (2) How is diversification ‘used’ as a farming strategy?  
  (3) What incentives and barriers are currently structuring the adoption of these strategies?

  We conducted Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews with 95 farmers across Tasmania and 
  analyzed them qualitatively using thematic analysis. Our findings show that attitudes and 
  motivations towards agricultural diversity vary among farmers depending on personal experiences, 
  values, and farming backgrounds. These motivations may influence the role that agricultural 
  diversity plays within farms.

  We could identify a net distinction between farmers using diversification strategies:  
  (1) as integral components of their business to respond to different needs and purposes,  
  (2) purely as additional business opportunities, or  
  (3) for motivations that go beyond the financial value.  

  Nevertheless, some farmers prefer specialization as they find it more profitable or consider 
  that investing in additional activities is too demanding or financially risky. 

  As only 14 farms in our sample specialized in a single product, our results suggest that 
  agricultural diversification strategies can also represent viable options in a high-income 
  country. However, the variety of responses and perspectives among the participants of this 
  study indicates that future research and policy interventions promoting agricultural diversity 
  should aim to identify and address the specific challenges encountered by the different 
  approaches to diversification employed by farmers.
