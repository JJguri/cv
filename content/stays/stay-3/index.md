### Wageningen University, The Netherlands; University of Gottingen and Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research, Germany

#### Period
29 May - 17 June 2018

#### Activities

**_Postgraduate Course The Netherlands_**

I attended to the a 6-day Postgraduate Course (3-8 June 2018) entitled “Fundamentals of Crop Physiology in a Changing World and organised by the C.T. De Wit Graduate School Production Ecology & Resource Conservation at Wageningen University in collaboration with the University of Florida.

Course lecturers included Frank Ewert, Ken Boote, Pierre Martre, Paul Struik, Xinyou Yin, Jochem Evers, Melanie Correll, and many others. The course focused on the fundamental knowledge and insight one must have about crops to be able to adapt agronomic practices to the changing world. The toolbox in this course was a variety of plant and crop models. The overall goal of this course was to understand the effects of temperature, light, CO2, and water on the carbon source-sink relationships of plants and to improve the underlying models.

**_Research visit Germany_**

I conducted a 4-day research visit to collaborators at University of Gottingen and Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research to discuss a project submission.

#### Achievements

We wrote a research proposal under the Australia-Germany Joint Research Co-operation Scheme which was granted (AUD$40,360).

#### Host Researchers in Germany
* Prof Stefan Siebert, Dr Ehsan Eyshi Rezaei (University of Göttingen)
* Dr Bahareh Kamali, Dr Heidi Webber, Dr Frank Ewert (Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research)

#### Funded by
Research Travel Funding Water for Profit Program, Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture

#### Grant amount
AUD $6,000
