### APSIM Advanced Training Workshop, Oro Verde, Argentina

#### Period
31 Jul - 2 Aug 2019

#### Activities

Dr Octavio Caviglia and I conducted a 3-day advanced modelling workshop at National University of Entre Rios. This workshop aimed to introduce the basis to run APSIM using real case studies from Argentina. The workshop included more than 15 participants (graduate and postgraduate students and INTA researchers). The main topics addressed were:

* Introduction to crop simulation models, modelling phases, spatial and temporal scales, statistical analyses.
* Model complexity, model parameterisation and evaluation, sensitivity analysis and model intercomparison e.g. APSIM _vs._ others biophysical models such as DSSAT, STICS.
* Minimum data requirements for model simulation.
* Modelling single crops, crop sequences and long-term rotations. Factorials and scenario analysis.

#### Achievements

Initial discussions about future collaborations and PhD student interchange between organisations

#### Host Researchers in Germany
