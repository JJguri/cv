### Research visitor from Argentina
#### 16-20 March 2020

Jose is an Agricultural Engineer from University of Tucuman, Argentina. He worked as a biosecurity inspector for the National Argentinian Government who oversee exportation programs for citrus, blueberries and tobacco, and supervising the harvest in grain productions like soybean, maize and black bean before moving to Australia. While in Australia he worked in farms around New South Wales and Victoria to learn about Australia’s agricultural and livestock production systems.

Jose participated in the APSIM Potato Modelling Project helping Dr. Ojeda 
and his team gathering potato samples from commercial farms (Simplot and McCain) 
located across Central and Northern Tasmania and recording relevant data for the 
project. He is currently looking for jobs related to Tasmania’s fruit and horticultural 
industries, biosecurity and research projects.
