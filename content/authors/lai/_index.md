Dr. Yunru (Chloe) Lai is a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Southern Queensland (USQ). 
Her research aims to improve the representation of soil constraints in agricultural systems models, and 
the integration of scientific advances in plant-soil-climate-management interaction to enable informed 
decision-making. She is particularly interested in quantifying the effects of soil constraints on crop 
production at different spatial and temporal scales through the use of statistical, machine-learning 
and mechanistic approaches to facilitate the development of soil improvement strategies that are practical, 
economic and system-integrated. Her research often requires her to work and collaborate across various 
disciplines including remote and proximal sensing, geostatistics, pedometrics, soil physics and chemistry 
and crop ecophysiology which she finds immensely stimulating.
