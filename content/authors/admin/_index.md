Jonathan is a Junior Research Fellow at the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture, University of Tasmania. His research interests are in quantifying the effects of crop management and climate variability on soil-crop processes and integrating data into mechanistic models at different spatial scales. He has a passionate interest in disentangle sources of uncertainties in biophysical and mathematical models to better predict crop growth, both yield and quality and environmental impacts in agricultural systems. This requires a broad understanding of how the environment influences crop growth and development; how rainfall, irrigation, and fertilizer influence soil conditions; how crops obtain water and nutrients from the soil; how soil processes contribute to the loss of carbon and nitrogen; and how all these processes interact.
