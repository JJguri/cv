I apply data analytics, statistics and programming to understand the crop ecophysiology behind crop models and remote 
sensing algorithms to improve crop production and reduce environmental impacts. My interests are in quantifying the 
effects of crop management, genetics and climate variability on soil-crop processes and integrating data into mechanistic 
models at different spatio-temporal scales. I have a passionate interest in disentangling sources of uncertainties/variability 
to better predict crop growth, both yield and quality and environmental indicators. This requires a broad understanding of 
how the environment and genetics influences crop growth/development; how rainfall, irrigation, and fertilizer influence 
soil conditions; how crops obtain water/nutrients from the soil; how soil processes contribute to the loss of C, N; and 
how all these processes interact.

Over 15 years of experience managing large soil-crop-climate datasets (6+ years using Python) and 10+ years developing the Agricultural 
Production Systems sIMulator ([APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/)) applying data pipelining and optimization towards solving large-scale 
real farm problems.
I collected (field experimental trials) and analysed data including >18 crop species (annual, perennials). I have more 
than 40 published articles
[[18 in high-impact journals](/publication) (12 as first author)]. I received 18 research grants 
(70% as chief investigator) with a cash value of ~AUD8.26M. I am currently mentoring [5 PhD students](/phd) in 
collaboration with international researchers and has previously supervised [5 Honours students](/#honours) to completion.

My current role at Regrow Ag focuses on developing digital solutions by linking geospatial data (crop, management, environment and genetics), 
models, sensors, and scientific knowledge to make decision support tools more efficient and world-wide applicable. I am leading
the [Niche](https://www.regrow.ag/post/regrow-leads-5m-project-niche-to-optimize-crop-variety-placement-in-sub-saharan-africa) 
project funded by B&M Gates Foundation which focuses on the analysis of GxExM in Sub-Saharan Africa. I work with data scientists, 
software developers and engineers to develop models/algorithms linking remote sensing data with crop/soil mechanistic models to predict crop phenology/yield, 
soil water, N and C dynamics in a broad range of agricultural systems. I work with multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary teams 
(Academia and Industry) and have experience working in 6 countries 
(Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, United States, The Netherlands and Germany). My experience worldwide in 
the public and private sectors testify to my readiness and capacity to work with teams across different locations whilst creating 
long standing and productive relationships.

I also hold two academic positions as Adjunct Senior Research Fellow at the Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Systems
(University of Southern Queensland) and Adjunct Researcher at the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture (University of Tasmania) in Australia.
