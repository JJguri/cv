I am leading the Science Team at Terradot developing a team and a MRV platform to measure & simulate C 
sequestration & yield compliant with global standards (e.g. Cascade, Isometric, VERRA). At Terradot, I 
worked in close collaboration with high-level Stanford & world-renowned Reactive Transport Modelers 
focused on CDR projects. I also hold an academic positions as Adjunct Senior Research Fellow at the Centre 
for Sustainable Agricultural Systems (University of Southern Queensland) in Australia. Currently, 
I built a team from scratch to >10 people in just 6 months, 
fostering a robust & efficient workforce. I lead my team to innovate, iterate, and excel, always 
keeping the end-goal in sight: delivering impactful solutions swiftly to stay ahead in the ever-evolving 
digital landscape. My career is anchored in a relentless pursuit of excellence, where delivering V0 products 
swiftly isn’t just a goal, it’s my standard.

I apply data analytics, statistics and programming to understand soil-crop-climate interactions 
behind coupled models. My interests are in quantifying the effects of crop management & climate/soil 
variability on CO2 removal and yield through mechanistic models ([APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/) & [MIN3P](https://www.min3p.com/)) 
at different spatio-temporal scales. 
I have a passionate interest in disentangling sources of uncertainties/variability to better predict 
yield and C (organic and inorganic) sequestration trough ERW field deployments. This requires a broad 
understanding of how the environment influences crop growth; how rainfall/irrigation, & applied rock 
influence soil status; how crops obtain water/nutrients from the soil; how soil processes contribute 
to the loss of C, N; and how all these processes interact.

Over 15 years of experience managing large soil-crop-climate datasets (8+ years using Python and 
geo-statistics), developing models (APSIM, 12+ years & MIN3P) & applying data pipelining and 
optimization towards solving large-scale ERW and C deployments. I collected (experiments) & 
analyzed data including >18 crop species (annual, perennials). I have 50+ published articles 
in high-impact journals (13 as first author). I received 18 research grants (70% as CI) with a cash value of ~USD5.5M.

I mentored graduate/[5 PhD students](/phd) who are currently leading global research in academia/industry. 
As part of Regrow Ag, I led a multicultural global team (15 people including data scientists, 
software developers and engineers) under the [Niche](https://www.regrow.ag/post/regrow-leads-5m-project-niche-to-optimize-crop-variety-placement-in-sub-saharan-africa)
project (USD4M) funded by B&MGF which focuses on the analysis of GxExM in Sub-Saharan Africa. 

During my career, I work with multi-cultural & multi-disciplinary teams (hybrid approach - 
Academia & Industry) & have ground experience working in 9 countries (Argentina, Brazil, 
Australia, NZ, USA, The Netherlands, Germany, Rwanda & Kenya).
