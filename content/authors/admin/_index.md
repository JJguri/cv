Jonathan (Jony) is a Data Scientist by nature. He applies his unique skill-set on data analytics and 
programming to understand the crop eco-physiology (soil-plant-climate interactions) behind crop model 
and remote sensing algorithms to improve crop production and reduce environmental impacts.
His research interests are in quantifying the effects of crop management and climate 
variability on soil-crop processes and integrating data into mechanistic models at different 
spatial scales. He has a passionate interest in disentangling sources of uncertainties in 
biophysical and mathematical models to better predict crop growth, both yield and quality and 
environmental impacts in agricultural systems. This requires a broad understanding of how the 
environment influences crop growth and development; how rainfall, irrigation, and fertilizer 
influence soil conditions; how crops obtain water and nutrients from the soil; how soil processes 
contribute to the loss of carbon and nitrogen; and how all these processes interact.

Jony has most than 15 years of experience managing large datasets and 
almost 10 years developing the Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator ([APSIM](https://www.apsim.info/)) 
to solve real farm problems worldwide. He has [40 published articles](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gzbcs04li2gs8yu/papers.csv?dl=0)
[[11 in high-impact journals](/publication) (10 as first author!)]. 
As a PhD, he received  12 research grants (8 as lead investigator) with a cash value of ~AUD1.2M. He is currently 
mentoring [5 PhD students](/phd) in collaboration with international researchers and has previously supervised 
[5 Honours students](/#honours) to completion. He works with multidisciplinary teams (Academia and Industry) 
and has experience working in 6 countries (Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, United States, The Netherlands and Germany).
