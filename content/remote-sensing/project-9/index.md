The **_Aerial Net Primary Productivity (ANPP)_** is an integrating variable of the ecosystem functioning 
that determines the ecosystem services provision. In livestock systems, the ANPP is the main 
determinant of energy available for the cattle, similarly to natural systems determines the 
energy available to wild herbivores. Therefore, estimate the ANPP and understand how it varies 
in space and over time, is an aspect of special interest. Estimates from harvests biomass are 
very time- and effort-demanding. ANPP can also be estimated from spectral data provided by 
remote manual sensors or on-board satellites. These estimates are derived from Monteith's 
radiative model, which establishes that ANPP results from the product between incident 
**_Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)_**, the fraction of this that is absorbed by the 
vegetation (**_fPAR_**) and the **_Radiation Use Efficiency (RUE)_**. PAR can be estimated using weather 
stations or models based on remote sensors. fPAR can be derived from spectral indices such as 
the **_Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)_** or the **_Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI)_** and 
represents the key link between remote sensing and ANPP estimation. Finally, the RUE can be 
estimated from the quotient between independent estimates of ANPP and absorbed radiation (the 
product between PAR and fPAR), or models based on climate information. Recently, it was 
shown that the RUE can be estimated from spectral signals such as fluorescence and Photochemical 
Reflectance Index (PRI). The RUE is the most elusive variable in the model and about which there 
is much uncertainty. Regarding the ANPP variations, its main determinant is the precipitation, 
with different patterns depending on the variation in space and over time. Recently, a typology 
of ecosystem change syndromes was defined which represents the set of response patterns of ANPP 
to precipitation. This typology is based on the **_Precipitation Use Efficiency (PUE)_** and the 
**_Marginal Response to Precipitation (MRP)_**. In this project we propose, on the one hand, to improve 
knowledge of the RUE variations and the possibility to estimate RUE by remote sensing. 
On the other hand, we propose to **_characterize syndromes of ecosystem change_** in temperate grasslands. 
While these two goals are independent, improving the knowledge of the RUE will imply a better 
estimate of ANPP, which will result in a more precise characterization of the syndromes of ecosystem 
change and its most probable biophysical and anthropic controls.
