summary: Identify the main contributors to the variance in model outputs
abstract: "This code is able to retrieve APSIM Next Generation outputs and carried out a variance decomposition analysis to identify the main contributors to the variance in selected model outputs. Functionality: Calculate the main (ME) and total effect (TE) of a series of factors on the variability of a selected variable (in this example crop biomass). ME explains the share of the components to model output variability without interactions, i.e. if ME=1, the assessed factors explain the entire proportion of model output variability, but if M<1, residuals exist which means additional factors are required to explain this variability. TE represents the interaction of a given factor with other factors, i.e. high TE values for a given factor denote high interactions of that factor with other factors, therefore, TE does not include residuals."
