“Niche” is a project that aims to optimize crop variety placement in Sub-Saharan Africa, led by Regrow Ag 
with NASA Harvest, One Acre Fund, and the University of Nebraska - Lincoln as key implementation partners. 
The project, which has been awarded a $5M, 4-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will bring 
together several key agriculture and climate tech partners to build an assessment framework and digital tools that will:

- Define and characterize the current and future performance of crop and variety adaptation zones in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
to advance the knowledge of seed breeders on climate adaptation in those specific zones
- Identifiy optimal variety placement for novel and existing crop varieties, so they can be effectively distributed to farmers

One of the main objectives of this project is to create a scenario analysis tool able to identify the best genotype for a given environment 
and crop management (based on end-user needs specified in previous section). To do that, we are working on the development of a 1- rigorous 
model calibration for phenology and grain yield and 2- scenario analysis tool which will be available through API and map visualisation. 

End users will be able to select specific crop management (N rate, sowing date, etc.) for a particular latitude/longitude combination 
and the Niche scenario tool will identify the best genotype cluster (high yield and  low inter-annual variability) for that given 
environment * crop management combination. The system also will generate information about which hybrids were part of the best 
genotypic cluster and the main factors driving the yield for the selected scenario.
