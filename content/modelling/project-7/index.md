“Niche” is a project that aims to optimize crop variety placement in Sub-Saharan Africa, led by Regrow Ag 
with NASA Harvest, One Acre Fund, and the University of Nebraska - Lincoln as key implementation partners. 
The project, which has been awarded a $5M, 4-year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will bring 
together several key agriculture and climate tech partners to build an assessment framework and digital tools that will:

- Define and characterize the current and future performance of crop and variety adaptation zones in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
to advance the knowledge of seed breeders on climate adaptation in those specific zones
- Identifiy optimal variety placement for novel and existing crop varieties, so they can be effectively distributed to farmers

One of the main objectives of this project is to create a scenario analysis tool able to identify the best genotype for a given environment 
and crop management (based on end-user needs specified in previous section). To do that, we were working on the development of a 1- rigorous 
model calibration and 2- scenario analysis tool (Fig. 1). The general approach presented below was generated after several 
discussions between Regrow and UNL. The University of Lincoln contributed to the development of both the model calibration and the scenario analysis tool.
